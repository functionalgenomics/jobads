## Job description

We are searching for a graduate student to contribute to the development of the open-source software project "GSVA: Optimizing Gene Set Variation Analysis for Single-Cell Data", funded by the [**Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI)**](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science) in the last call for [Essential Open Source Software for Science](https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/gsva-optimizing-gene-set-variation-analysis-for-single-cell-data). The candidate will work in the [research group of Robert Castelo](https://functionalgenomics.upf.edu) at the Department of Medicine and Life Sciences from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra ([UPF](https://www.upf.edu)), in the Barcelona Biomedical Research Park ([PRBB](https://prbb.org)), in Barcelona, Spain and in close collaboration with Justin Guinney, senior researcher at [Tempus Labs](https://www.tempus.com), USA. With over 1,400 residents, the PRBB has a large critical mass of scientists from different institutions at the forefront of research in bioinformatics and computational biology, giving the possibility to attend seminars, conferences and soft-skills training.

[GSVA](https://bioconductor.org/packages/GSVA) is an R/Bioconductor package that facilitates pathway-centric analyses of molecular data. With more than 200,000 downloads and 5,000 citations to the [paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-14-7) describing it, GSVA has become a very popular open-source software. We offer a graduate student to carry out his/her master's thesis project in the framework of adapting GSVA to analyse spatial transcriptomics data.

## Specific requirements

* BSc or higher degree in either computer science, engineering, mathematics, physics or in the life sciences with a motivation for scientific method and software development.

* Ideally enrolled in a master's programme in the field of bioinformatics, biostatistics, data science, mathematics or related discipline, in which a master's project should be developed during the academic year 2023-24. Candidates not enrolled in a master's programme may be considered if they have a strong profile in the other requirements.

* Solid knowledge of fundamental statistics and programming, ideally with R.

* Fluency in written and spoken English. Excellent teamwork and collaboration skills.

* High motivation for interdisciplinary work, and particularly, for contributing to address questions of biological and clinical relevance.

## Compensation and benefits

We offer a full-time two-year contract starting on the third trimester of 2023, funded by the CZI, with a gross salary of a PhD student, about 17,000 EUR/year (monthly gross salary of about 1,400EUR), including the standard health benefits of an European Union member state.

## Application process

Send CV and letter of interest, including names of two referees that could send a recommendation letter to robert.castelo@upf.edu (REF: CZI_GSVA). Additional information about this job offer can be also requested to the same email address.
